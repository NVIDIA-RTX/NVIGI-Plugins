# NVIDIA In-Game Inference AI Plugins
Version 1.0.0 Release

In-Game Inferencing (NVIGI) is an open-sourced cross platform solution that simplifies integration of the latest NVIDIA and other provider's technologies into applications and games. This framework allows developers to easily implement one single integration and enable multiple technologies supported by the hardware vendor or cloud provider. Supported technologies include AI inference but, due to the generic nature of the NVIGI SDK, can be expanded to graphics or any other field of interest.

For high-level details of NVIGI, as well as links to the official downloads for the product, see [NVIDIA In-Game Inferencing](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/in-game-inferencing)

This directory contains the main AI plugins for integrating In-Game Inferencing-based AI workflows into your application.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> For important changes and bug fixes included in the current release, please see the release notes at the end of this document BEFORE use.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- NVIDIA RTX 30x0/A6000 series or (preferably) RTX 4080/4090 or RTX 5080/5090 with a minimum of 8GB and recommendation of 12GB VRAM.  

> NOTE: Some plugins only support RTX 40x0 and above, and will not be available on RTX 30x0.

### Windows

- Win10 20H1 (version 2004 - 10.0.19041) or newer
- Install graphics driver r555.85 or newer
- Install VS Code or VS2019/VS2022 with [SDK 10.0.19041+](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120843)

### NVIGI Components

NVIGI consists of several independent components, of which this SDK directory is only one.  Normally, several of these components are used together, and in many cases, developers will actually receive a combined, "standard-layout" pack that is easier to use out of the box.  This SDK directory contains plugins focused upon AI inference, especially speech recognition, large language models, and embeddings.  It relies upon and requires the NVIGI core APIs, which are shipped as `nvigi_core` Plugin Development Kit (PDK), either as:
- A downloaded and unzipped stand-alone NVIGI Core PDK binary pack
- A locally cloned and built copy of the `nvigi_core` git repository (generally located in a git repo parallel to the one containing this SDK plugins repo).  In general, simply building all configurations of Core from source and then using the NVIGI-Core source tree root as the location of the PDK should work.  See the NVIGI Core README for details on how one can build and package a built NVIGI Core source repo into a PDK.  

NVIGI core is documented in detail in its own documentation, which should be available in either tree.  Developers should read the documentation in `nvigi_core` to gain a basic understanding of the overall architecture into which the plugins in this source tree plug into.

## DIRECTORY SETUP

As noted, building the NVIGI plugins SDK from source requires access to a fully-built local copy of the NVIGI Core PDK.  We will call the location of this PDK `<NVIGI_CORE>`.

In the following instructions,
- `<NVIGI_CORE>` should be replaced with the fully path to the NVIGI Core PDK, either pulled pre-built or built from git source.  See above for details.
- `<SDK_PLUGINS>` should be replaced with the full path to your NVIGI SDK directory (the path of this README).
- `<SDK_MODELS>` refers to the location of the `nvigi.models` AI models directory.
  - This is available in `<SDK_PLUGINS>/data/nvigi.models`
- `<SDK_TEST>` refers to the location of the `nvigi.test` AI test data directory.
  - This is available in `<SDK_PLUGINS>/data/nvigi.test`

### Required connection from the SDK to the Core PDK

> **IMPORTANT:** 
> The NVIGI SDK plugins tree (this tree) requires that there be a junction link from `<SDK_PLUGINS>/nvigi_core` to `<NVIGI_CORE>`
> Create this by running the following in a command prompt whose current working directory is `<SDK_PLUGINS>`:

`mklink /j nvigi_core <NVIGI_CORE>` 

This must be done before running any further setup!

## Basic Steps: Summary

The following sections detail each of the steps of how to set up, rebuild and run the samples in this pack from the debugger or command line.  But the basic steps are:
1. Generate the project files
   1. Open a VS2022 Development Command Prompt to the SDK (a.k.a. `<SDK_PLUGINS>`) directory
   2. Run `setup.bat`
> NOTE:
> If `setup.bat` fails with an error from the `packman` package downloader, please re-run `setup.bat` again as there are rare but possible issues with link-creation on initial run.

2. Build the project, which will build the plugins and samples from source
   1. Launch VS2022
   2. Load `<SDK_PLUGINS>/_project/vs2022/nvigi.sln` as the workspace
   3. Build the Release configuration
3. Copy the updated binaries into the expected, packaged locations
   1. Open a (or use an existing) VS2022 Development Command Prompt to the SDK (a.k.a. `<SDK_PLUGINS>`) directory
   2. Run `copy_sdk_binaries.bat Release`
4. Run the sample (assumes that the models have been downloaded as per initial setup instructions)
   1. Open a (or use an existing) VS2022 Development Command Prompt to the SDK (a.k.a. `<SDK_PLUGINS>`) directory
   2. Run `bin\x64\nvigi.basic.exe --models data\nvigi.models`

## Setup 

> **IMPORTANT:** 
> As noted above, there must be a junction link from `<SDK_PLUGINS>/nvigi_core` to your built and packaged copy of the NVIGI Core PDK, `<NVIGI_CORE>`. 

This should be done via the command
 `mklink /j nvigi_core <NVIGI_CORE>` 

To setup the NVIGI repository for building and running the Samples, open a command prompt window or PowerShell to the `<SDK_PLUGINS>` directory and simply run the following command:

```sh
setup.bat
```

> **IMPORTANT:** 
> These steps are listed in the following section are done for you by the `setup.bat` script - **do not run these steps manually/individually**.  This is merely to explain what is happening for you.

When you run the `setup.bat` script, the script will cause two things to be done for you:

1. The NVIDIA tool `packman` will pull all build dependencies to the local machine and cache them in a shared directory.  Links will be created from `external` in the NVIGI tree to this shared cache for external build dependencies.
2. `premake` will generate the project build files in `_project\vs20XX` (for Windows)

> NOTE:
> If `setup.bat` fails with an error from the `packman` package downloader, please re-run `setup.bat` again as there are rare but possible issues with link-creation on initial run.

## Building

To build the project, simply open `_project\vs20XX\nvigi.sln` in Visual Studio, select the desired build configuration and build.

> NOTE: To build the project minimal configuration is needed. Any version of Windows 10 will do. Then
run the setup and build scripts as described here above. That's it. The specific version of Windows, and NVIDIA driver 
are all runtime dependencies, not compile/link time dependencies. This allows NVIGI to build on stock
virtual machines that require zero configuration.

## "Installing" Built Binaries

Once you build your own binaries, either the SDK DLLs or the Sample executable, those will reside in `_artifacts`, not `bin\x64`.  After building any configuration (Release, Debug, etc), you will need to run the `copy_sdk_binaries.bat <cfg>` script.  If you build the Release config, this would be:

1. Open a command prompt to the SDK root
1. run `copy_sdk_binaries.bat Release`

This will copy the core lib, the DLLs and the exes to `bin\x64` and should be done before trying the next section.

## Samples

Setting up and running the samples as shipped pre-built or built using the instructions above is discussed in detail in [Samples](docs/Samples.md)

## Changing an Existing Project

> IMPORTANT: Do not edit the MSVC project files directly!  Always modify the `premake.lua` or files in `premake`.

When changing an existing project's settings or contents (ie: adding a new source file, changing a compiler setting, linking to a new library, etc), it is necessary to run `setup.bat` again for those changes to take effect and MSVC project files and or solution will need to be reloaded in the IDE.

> NOTE: NVIDIA does not recommend making changes to the headers in `include`, as these can affect the API itself and can make developer-built components incompatible with NVIDIA-supplied components.

## Sample App and Source

A 3D-rendered sample application using In-Game Inferencing may be found in most SDK packs.  If the pack is in standard layout, this will be in a sibling directory of `sdk` called `sample`.  There is a `README` in that directory with detailed instructions.
