2. Log into NGC with the enabled account
3. Navigate to https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ace/models/nemovision-4b-instruct/files (if this shows an error of "This page requires a subscription", ensure that you have logged into the correct NGC account)
4. Download the nemovision-4b-instruct-clip_gguf.zip file - 
5. Open the zip file
6. Unzip the following files from the "gguf" subdirectory into the directory containing this README and nvigi.model.config.json (i.e. without the gguf directory hierarchy)
- minitron.gguf
- mmproj-model-f16.gguf
The model can then be loaded via its GUID in an application
